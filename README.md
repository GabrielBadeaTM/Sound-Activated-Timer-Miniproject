# 🎯 Sound-Activated Timer

A practical sound-controlled timer designed to be operated hands-free, ideal for timing physical activities without interrupting motion.  
Built around an Arduino-compatible microcontroller with a microphone sensor, 7-segment display, LEDs, and buzzer feedback.  

Developed as a mini project for academic purposes, demonstrating sensor integration and microcontroller control.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Microphone analog sensor
- 4-digit 7-segment display
- LEDs (green and red)
- Buzzer
- Arduino IDE (C++)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The microphone detects loud sounds (e.g., claps).
2. One clap toggles the timer between start and pause states.
3. Two quick claps reset the timer and trigger an audible high-pitched beep.
4. The 7-segment display shows elapsed time in minutes and seconds (format `M.SS`).
5. LEDs indicate timer status: green for running, red for paused.
6. The buzzer emits short beeps every second and a reset beep when applicable.

This setup allows timing without physical interaction, ideal for workouts or other hands-busy tasks.
